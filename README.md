# COPAAL
# Paper
This repository contains code (service and demo) for the paper and demo titled "*Unsupervised Discovery of Corroborative Paths for FactValidation*" and "*COPAAL â€“ An Interface for Explaining Facts usingCorroborative Paths*" respectively, accepted at **International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC-2019)**.

# Description
COPAAL is an unsupervised fact validation approach for RDF knowledge graphs which identifies paths that support a given fact *(s,p,o)*. This approach is based on the insight that the predicate *p* (e.g.,**nationality**) carries mutual information with a set of other paths (e.g., paths pertaining to **birthPlace** and **country**) in the background knowledge graph *G*. Hence,the presence of certain sets of paths in *G* that begin in *s* and end in *o* can be regarded as evidence which corroborates the veracity of *(s,p,o)*. For example, we would have good reasons to believe that **BarackObama** is a citizen of the **USA** given that **BarackObama** was born in **Hawaii** and **Hawaii** is located in the **USA** (see figure below).

# Usage Instructions
To run COPAAL, do the following:
- Clone the respository using the command `git clone --single-branch --branch COPAAL-AFIRM https://github.com/dice-group/COPAAL.git`
- Navigate to COPAAL folder (cd COPAAL) and run `mvn clean package`

After the project is build successfully, you can run COPAAL either from an IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
- To run in an IDE, load the project in the IDE and run AFIRMLabDemo.java file. Configure the editor to pass the following command line arguments
1. -host XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (IP address of the host running SPARQL service)
2. -port YYYY (port on the host where the SPARQL service is running)
3. -output /home/output (path to output directory to generate output file)

AFIRMLabDemo is configured to run the US_Vice-President dataset. When running, you should see the following message in your console

``Generating result file for US-Vice-President dataset....``

Note that this run may take 13-15 mins. Once the program is finished, you can will see further instructions on how to submit the results to GERBIL platform
